# libDEMO2  

**!work in progress!**

It's a small demo of a library management system. It is made for learning object oriented c++ purpose and surely shouldn't be implemented in a real librarian environment - the program mainly processes few .txt files, so they are **not encrypted** and can be dangerous for the real life use.
