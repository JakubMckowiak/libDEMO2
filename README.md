# libDEMO2  

**!work in progress!**

It's a small demo of a library management system. It is made for learning object oriented c++ purpose and surely shouldn't be implemented in a real librarian environment - the program mainly processes few .txt files, so they are ==not encrypted== and can be dangerous for the real life use. 

Existing functionality:

- [x] Adding new books to the memory
- [x] Finding books in the memory
- [x] Deleting books from the memory

Planned functionality:

- [ ] Adding new users
- [ ] Adding books to a user account
- [ ] Getting information about certain users from the memory
- [ ] Deleting users from the memory
